# Part 2

While you were counting the parts, some eager elves had already started! They put toys together and packed them, but they forgot what was in them again. Strangely enough, they still know how many parts they've used.

The elves only packed toys, and no parts such as batteries or iron. Apparently no one has been naughty this year.

In the previous example, there were 46 missing parts. Suppose 3 gifts were already packed. Zoinks and Floops are the possible toys here, because they are not used as parts. There is only 1 way to make exactly 3 pieces of toy with all the missing parts: 2 Zoinks and 1 Floep (14 + 14 + 18 = 46) .

If you know the pieces of toy, you can find your answer by putting the first letters of the toy in alphabetical order. In the example above, this would therefore be `FZZ` .

20 gifts have already been packed. Given the number of missing items in the toy list, what are the initials (in alphabetical order)?
